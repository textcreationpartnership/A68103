            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:624:7"/> bearing up of Prelates tailes, and that of Prelates as unworthie of reſpect as any that ever wore a Mytre. Let our kindred, let our friends, let all the Proteſtant churches periſh, let our own lives &amp; eſtates run never ſo evident an hazard, yet the Prelates pride muſt be borne up, their furious deſire of revenge muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate; all their <hi>Mandamus</hi> in theſe dominions muſt be execute with greater ſeveritie and rigour then thoſe of their brethren are this day in <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Spaine,</hi> or thoſe of their grand-father at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To us ſurely it is a ſtrange <hi>Paradox,</hi> that a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of England,<note place="margin">The Canterburian faction deſerveth not ſo well of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land that armes in their favour ought to be taken againſt Scotland.</note> ſo wiſe, grave, equitable a Court, as in all bygone times it hath ever proven, ſhould bee thought in danger at any time, let be now to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by any allurement, by any terrour, to ſubmitt themſelves as Varlets and Pages to the execution of the luſts, the furies and outragious counſels of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turberrie</hi> and his dependars, for they know much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then we, that the maine greevances both of their Church and State, have no other originall, no other fountaine on earth but thoſe men. Who other but they have keept our moſt gracous Prince at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Countrie almoſt ever ſince he came to the Crowne? For whoſe cauſe have Parliaments theſe many yeares beene hindred to meet, and when they haue met, beene quickly raiſed, to the unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able grief and prejudice of the whole land, and of all our friends abroad. By whoſe connivence is it that the idolatrous Chappels of both the Queenes in the moſt conſpicuous places of the Court are ſo gorgeous and much frequented? Whoſe tollerance is it that at <hi>London</hi> three Maſſe-prieſts are to bee found for one Miniſter, that three hundreth of them reſide in the
<pb facs="tcp:624:8"/> cittie in ordinat, and ſix thouſand at leaſt in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. If yee truſt the Jeſuites Catalogue to <hi>Rome?</hi> Whence comes their immunitie from the Lawes, who have ſett up Cloyſters for Monks &amp; Nuns, let bee houſes for open Maſſes in divers cities of the Kings dominions? Why is our correſpondence with the <hi>Pope</hi> no more ſecret, but our Agents avowedly ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> &amp; his <hi>Holineſſe Nuntioes</hi> received here in ſtate, and that ſuch ones as in publick writs have lately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed with unſpeakable reproaches the perſon and birth of that moſt ſacred Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Such actions, or at leaſt long permiſſion of ſuch abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions doe they flow from any other but his Grace, the head &amp; heart of the Cabbine Counſell. Did any other but hee &amp; his creatures, his legs and armes hinder al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies our effectual alliance with the <hi>Sweeds</hi> &amp; <hi>French,</hi> when their armies did moſt flouriſh in <hi>Germanie</hi> for the relief of the oppreſſed Churches. Why was that poore Prince the king of <hi>Boheme</hi> to his dying day keept from any conſiderable help from <hi>Britaine?</hi> How was theſe young Princes the other yeare permitted to take the fields with ſo ſmall forces, that a very meane power of a ſilly commander beat them both, tooke the one captive, and put the other in his flight to an evident hazard of his life. Who moved that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Prince after his eſcape to take ſo ſtrange a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell as the world now ſpeake off, and when he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadged, who did betray both his purpoſe and perſon to the French king, could any without the Cabbine underſtand the convey of ſuch matters, and within that Cabbine does any come without his Graces per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion? Is not that man the evident author of all the Scotiſh broyles? Are not his Letters extant, his
<pb facs="tcp:624:8"/> holy hands interlynings of the Scotiſh ſervice to bee ſeene, his other writtes alſo are in our hands, making manifeſt that the beginning and continuance of that curſed worke hath no ſpring without his braine.</p>
            <p>When the King himſelfe after ripe advertiſement and all about him both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> had returned in peace, who incontinent did change the face of the Court, and revive that fire, which in the heart of the Prince and all his good Subjects was once cloſſe dead.</p>

If by their own teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie we make it evident that beſide bookes, cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and Biſhops which make the proper &amp; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular quarrel of this nationall Kirk againſt them, they are guilty of groſſe <hi>Arminianiſme,</hi> plaine popery, and of ſetting up of barbarous tyrannie, which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon quarrell of the Kirk of England of all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Kirks, and of all men who delite not to live &amp; dye in the fetters of ſlavery. If we demonſtrate, not ſo much by their preachings and practiſes amongſt us, as by their maximes, printed with priviledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your ſelvs, which to this day, though oft preſſed thereto, they have never recanted. If wee ſhew that yet ſtill they ſtifly avow all the articles of <hi>Arminius,</hi> a number of the groſſeſt abominations of popery, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the authoritie of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they urge concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that will force you without any reluctance, ſo much as by a verball proteſtation, not onely to give way unto any iniquitie whatſoever, either in Kirk or State whereto they can get ſtollen the pretext of the kings name, but alſo to lay down your neck under the yoke of the king of Spaine, if once he had any ſitting in this Yle, without any further reſiſtance, though in your Church by force that Tyrant ſhould ſet up the latine Maſſe in place of the Bible, and in your State, for your <hi>Magna-Charta</hi> and acts of Parliament, the Lawes of Caſtile, though in your eyes he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the whole race of the royall familie, though the remainder of the Nobilitie and Gentrie in the Land ſhould be ſent over by him, ſome to worke in fetters in his Mines of <hi>Peru,</hi> others in chayns to row all their dayes in his gallayes in the <hi>Mediterrane,</hi> for all theſe or any other imaginable acts of tyrannie that could
<pb facs="tcp:624:9"/> eſcape the wicked head of any mad <hi>Nero,</hi> of any monſtrous <hi>Caligula;</hi> theſe men doe openly take upon them to perſwade that no kinde of reſiſtance for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence can bee made by the whole States of a Land, though ſitting in Parliament, with a moſt harmonious conſent, no more then the Jewes might have done againſt <hi>Nabuchadnezar,</hi> or the Chriſtians of old a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pagane Emperours, or the Greeke Church this day againſt the grand <hi>Signieur</hi> in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that all our forbeares both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> in their manifold bickerings againſt the miſleaders of their Prince; againſt the tyrannizing factions of Court, were ever Traitours and Rebels, and ought to have looſed their head and Lands for their preſumption to defend their Liberties, againſt the intollerable inſolencies of a pack of runnigate Villanes for their boldneſſe, to faſten the tottering Crowne upon the head of their Kings, all ſuch Services of our Anteceſſours to King and Countrie, were treacherous inſurrections.</p>
            <p>If for all theſe their crimes I make ſpeake before you no other witneſſes then our owne tongue,<note place="margin">Armes needleſſe taken in ſo evill a cauſe, can not but end in an untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous repentance.</note> I truſt they ſhall not remaine in your mindes the leaſt ſhaddow of any ſcruple, to beleeve my allegations, nor in your wills the leaſt inclination to joyne with the Counſells of ſo polluted and ſelf-convicted perſons.</p>
            <p>And if to men whoſe open profeſſion in their printed Bookes, let be ſecret practiſes leads to ſo wicked ends, ſo farre contrarie to the glorie of God, to the honour and ſafetie of our King, to the well of us all, whether in Soule, Body, Eſtate, Children, or any thing that is deare to us, yee would lead
<pb facs="tcp:624:10"/> your armes againſt us; we beleeve the Lord of Hoſts, the righteous judge would be oppoſite to you, and make hundreds of your men in ſo evill a cauſe flee before ten of ours. Or, if it were the profound and unſearchable pleaſure of the God of Armies, to make you for a time a ſcourge to beate us, for our manifold tranſgreſſions; yet when ye had obtained all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates intentions, when wee for our others ſins were tred under your feete, wee would for all that hope to die with great comfort and courage, as defenders of the truth of God, of the Liberties and Lawes of our Countrie, of the true, good, and honour of the Crown and Royall Familie; All which as we take it, one of the moſt wicked and unnaturall faction that ever this Iſle did breed, are manifeſtly oppugning; yet certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we could not but leave in our Teſtament to you our unjuſt oppreſſors the legacie of an untimous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; for when ye have killed thouſands of us, &amp; baniſhed the reſt out of the iſle, when on the back of our departure, your ſweete Foſters the Biſhops have brought the Pope upon you and your Children; or when a <hi>French</hi> &amp; <hi>Spaniſh</hi> invaſion doth threaten you with a ſlaviſh conqueſh; Wil ye not then all, &amp; above all our gracious Prince regrate, that Hee hath beene ſo evill adviſed, as to have put ſo many of his brave Subjects to the cruell ſword, who were very able and moſt willing to have done him noble ſervice againſt theſe forraine uſurpers? Would not at ſuch a time, that is too likely to be at hand, if our Prelates adviſes now be followed, both his Majeſtie, and all of you who ſhall remaine in life, bee moſt earneſt recallers; not onely of your owne Countrie-men, (many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands whereof ye know have lately by Epiſcopall ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie

            <p>It were better by much, before the remeedileſſe ſtroke be given, to be well adviſed, then out of time to ſigh, when the millions of loſt lives, when the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe of our true Religion, when the liberties of both the nations, once throwen away by our owne hands, can not againe be recovered.</p>
            <p>To the end therefore that ſuch lamentable incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences may be eſhewed,<note place="margin">In this nick of time very poore wittes without preſumption may venture to ſpeake to Parliaments.</note> and your Honours the more animate to deny your power to thoſe, who now poſſiblie may crave to have it abuſed againſt us, without cauſe, beſide numbers of preſſing reaſons, wherewith I doubt not every wiſe man amongſt you is come well enough inſtructed by his owne conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and which I truſt ſhall be further preſented in plentie by theſe of our Nation, who have ever beene at the head of our affaires, whom God hath ſtill enabled to cleare the juſtice and neceſſitie of all our proceedings hitherto, to the mindes of all, ſave our infatuat adverſaries, whom ſuperſtition and rage hath blinded.

               <p>In this their doing the Judicious may perceive their manifold deceit, whereby they would delude the ſimple, and many wittie worldlings doe deceive themſelves.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they would have the world to thinke that we obſtinately refuſe to obey the Magiſtrate, in the point of things indifferent: And therefore unneceſſarily, and in a fooliſh preciſeneſſe draw upon our ſelves the wrath of the King.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when in our late Aſſemblies the order of our Church is made knowne, and the ſeeds of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, hereſie, idolatrie, and antichriſtian tyrannie are diſcovered in the Service-Booke and Canons, they wipe their mouth, they ſay: No ſuch thing is meant; and that we may upon the like occaſion blame the Service-Booke of England.</p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:624:38"/> elements: For I hope they will bee loath to affirme, that there is in the altar any worthineſſe or aptitude or any other cauſe imaginable, which can make it capable of adoration, but the ſame cauſes are in the elements in a farre higher degree: The relation to Chriſts Body and Perſon, which they make the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foundation of thoſe worships being much more true, more near, more clear in the elements, then in the altar, howſoever the Popiſh proſtrations, and adorations, before the hoſtie; which to all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants is ſo abominable idolatry, are abſolved by theſe men, not onely by the clearing of Papiſts of all idolatrie everie where, but particularly by their impatience, to have the adoration of the elements to be called Popiſh. For in our book of Canons when in the copie ſent up to the King, the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bread, Chap. 6.

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes not to ſtrive for words, our aſſertion is, that the groſſeſt of the Roman errours which in the common ſtile of Proteſtants, wont to go for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, are maintained by the Canterburians for ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke trueth.

And as this kinde is to be performed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie men, ſo it is not alwayes ſo needfull, but when neceſſitie required: for when things are ſetled there needs no more ſetling, but only preſerving, Wee ought not to have many <hi>Moſeſes,</hi> or many Euangeliſts, nor many Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les; Were people now to bee called and converted to the Goſpel, then not only this kinde of preaching, but miracles alſo were needfull, when much needleſſe and ſome unſound teaching by tract of time had ſued into the ark of Chriſts Church, by the Prelats and Prieſts therof: Then in the 19. year of King <hi>Henrie</hi> the eight began licences to be granted by the Court of <hi>Starchamber,</hi> to preach againſt the corruptions of the time; but now the corruptions are removed, the ancient and true doctrine of the primitive Church by ſetled articles is reſtored; Therefore this extraordinarie kinde is not now ſo neceſſarie, except it bee upon ſome notorious crimes, breaking foorth among people.</note> 4.

The Papiſts to the end that their conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie words may bee whiſpered upon the elements for their change, and no wayes heard of the people,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:624:63"/> who perchance if they heard and underſtood them, might learne them by heart, and in their idleneſſe might pronunce them over their meales, and ſo, which once they ſay was done, tranſubſtantiat their ordinarie food into Chriſts bodie: For the eſhewing of theſe inconveniences they ordaine the conſecration to bee made in the outmoſt corner of the church, ſo far from the ears of the people as may be; and for the greater ſecuritie, they ordaine their prieſts in the time of conſecration, both to ſpeake low, and to turne their backs upon the people: For to remeed their wicked follies, the Engliſh expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordained their communion Table to ſtand in the body of the church, where the Miniſter in the mids of the people might read out openly all the words of the Inſtitution. But our men to returne to the old faſhion, command the table to beſet at the Eaſt end of the Chancell, that in the time of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, the prieſt may ſtand ſo far removed from the people, as the furtheſt wall of the church can permit, and as this diſtance were not enough to keep theſe holy words of conſecration from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faine eares of Laicks, our booke hath a ſecond Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, injoining expreſſely the prieſt in the time of conſecration to turne his back on the people, to come from the North end of table, and to ſtand at ſuch a place where hee may uſe both his hands with more decencie and eaſe, which is not poſſible but on the Weſtſide alone; for on the South ſide the commoditie is juſt alike as in the North.

Shall anie wonder that ſo long as ſuch men get leave to ſpread, without a reply, ſuch horrible calumnies of us, that the heart of our gracious Prince, and manie about him ſhould be much inflammed to our hatred?</p>
            <p>What he ſpeaketh of divine inſtitution of Kings, wee doe believe it, that by God Kings doe reigne, it is plaine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; as alſo that all advancement is neither from the Eaſt, nor the Weſt, but from the hand of the moſt High: So that all who denie to any Superiour the obedience which is due to their Lawfull commands, muſt ſinne againſt God: We grant that ſome of our Oppoſites have here a conceit which we doe not well underſtand, they ſeeme to teach that royaltie alone, and that moſt abſolute, without any limitation, is of divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:624:83"/> that all other governments whether of republick or ariſtocracies are but humane inventions, oppoſite to the Law of nature and the firſt inſtitution of God; This ſtate-ſpeculia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeemeth to us a curioſitie, wherewith we have nothing to doe; it is enough for us to beleeve that our King is ſet over us by God as his Deputy; that ſince the time our old anceſtours did chooſe <hi>Fergus</hi> for their King, oblidging themſelves by their oath to be ruled by his race alone, according to the laws made, and to be made with publick conſent, yea, ſince the days of King <hi>Kenneth</hi> the third, to be governed by his neareſt heire: Our ſubiection to the neareſt heire of that race is now ſimplie unchangeable:</p>
            <p>The leaſt motion of any ſuch change hath as little come in the minde of our Nation in theſe dayes of King <hi>Charles,</hi> as in any age of the laſt two thouſand Yeares, wherein our Fathers have ſhewed more conſtant affection to the ſervice of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teceſſours, then any other Nation under the Heaven this day to their royall families.

               </gap>at here ye rechant of our minde to a reſiſtance and defenſive warre in ſome caſes, is nothing contrarie to this our profeſſion; Many bickerings have our predeceſſours had with miſleading factions, to which the Prince for a time hath given his countenance, but they were ever willing to diſtinguiſh betwixt the Prince and his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>informers,<note place="margin">3. Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell, The Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s give to the Prince much more power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Church, then the Ieſuites give to the Pope.</note> to ſee them puniſhed when their inſolent tyrannie become intolerable; but the Prince ſetled in the full ſtrength of his authoritie, which for a time the cloud of theſe graſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers did eclipſe in the hearts of his people.</p>
            <p>The third point wherein ye joyne us with the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> is our denying to the King the government of the Church: In this ye doe us wrong, as in all the reſt, for we reiect the Popiſh doctrine here; They make Princes meer ſheep, they command them to follow the Pope their paſtor, where ever he leads, were it to the bottome of Hell, without asking ſo much as <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine quid facis,</hi> but we eſteeme it to be a chiefe part of the Magiſtrates office to command all Church-men to doe their dutie, and when they will not be perſwaded with cleare rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:624:83"/> to compell them by force to reforms the corruptions in the worſhip of God; But ye skift out here much further to an extravagance, wherein ye have no approved divine to be your patron.</p>
            <p>Yee teach, that all Soveraignes are the true heads of the Churches in their Dominions; Such ſtyles the Biſhops of England ſince the beginning of Queene <hi>EliZabeths</hi> reigne, have ever denyed to their Princes, with their owne content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Ye will have not only the Magiſtrate to command that which is right in the ſervice of God, as <hi>Austine</hi> and wee doe gladly grant, but alſo ye make it his right, were he a profeſſed heretick, or Pagan, to give what lawes he will to the Church, without her conſent, or ſo much as advice: Ye give to the Prince much more, then the <hi>Ieſuites</hi> will grant to the Pope, to doe in the Church even without a Counſell, what he thinkes meeteſt, and if it be his pleaſure to call a Counſell, ye make it his only right to call either of the laitie or the Cleargie, whom he will, to be members thereof, and when theſe members are conveened, ye give to the Prince alone the power of judging and deciding, and to all others but of meere advice; Except ſo farre as the Prince is pleaſed to communicate to ſo many of them as he thinkes meete his owne deciſive voice. In ſuch a Counſell, or without it, ye make it the Princes right, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy at his pleaſure all Church-Canons, Church-judicatories, and formes of divine worſhip, which by Lawes and long cuſtomes have been eſtabliſhed, and to impoſe new Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Faith, new Eccleſiaſticke judicatories, new Bookes of Canons, Leiturgie, Ordination, Homilies, Pſalmes, by meere authoritie.</p>
            <p>All this by your perſwaſion yee moved our Prince to aſſay, but upon better information his royall juſtice is now pleaſed to reiect all ſuch your deſignes, for his Majeſtie hath given to us aſſurance, not only at his Campe, but by his Commiſſioner in our laſt Aſſemblie; and we hope alſo that at once this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance ſhall be confirmed in Parliament, that no eccleſiaſtick no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſhal over be required by his Maj: but that wherto a free

            <p>Is all oppoſition to you in theſe things <hi>Ieſuitiſme?</hi> what ever difference we have here with you, yet with our Prince in this point we are fully agreed.</p>
            <p>Your gratious Brethren and Fathers when we had beene in poſſeſſion continually after the reformation, for common, of two generall Aſſemblies yearlie, by their wicked dealing ſpoiled us of all that Libertie, ſo that for 38 Yeares ſpace wee had no generall Aſſemblie to count of but two, both which were thruſt upon us againſt our heart for the advancement alone of their evill purpoſes: Yet now, thankes be to God, our Prince being wel informed of the miſchivous wrong your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie did to us in this matter, hath granted our reaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, if ſo be the like of you, make not this grant fruitleſſe unto us, as ye truely intend; The old act of Parliament for yearlie generall Aſſemblies, and ofter <hi>pro re nata,</hi> is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Kings Commiſſioner to be very reaſonable, and with his conſent hath paſt the articles of our late Parliament, ſo that our Prince now is very well content that from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Aſſemblie the higheſt Eccleſiaſtick Court, being ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

            <p>Ye doe well by the paſſages of <hi>King James</hi> writs which hee let fall in paſſion againſt ſome few perſons as himſelfe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to incite <hi>King Charles</hi> to deſtroy the whole generation of your oppoſits.</p>
            <p>For that equivocation which ye obiect to ſome in their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing of the Covenant at the Commiſſioners and Counſels direction; ſufficient ſatisfaction is given long agoe to all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable men by publiſhed writs: The matter ſhortly was this, one of your factious ingines, to draw us ſubtilie from that Covenant, wherein we did abiure Biſhops, Bookes, and the reſt of your novations, which were contrarie to the doctrine and diſcipline of our Church, was, a new ſubſcription to the firſt part of this Covenant, as it was firſt ſet downe in the yeare 1580, without our late addition, wherein it was applyed to your newly obtruded novations: Upon hope by this new ſubſcription, that not only, the formerly ſubſcribed addition and abjuration of theſe novelties expreſſed in that addition, ſhould be forgotten; but alſo that meanes ſhould be gotten to perſwade that theſe once abiured novations were in nothing contrary to the Kings Covenant, yea that all of them were ſo much conforme to it, and virtually contained therein, that all the ſubſcrivers ſhould finde themſelves oblidged by that oath and ſubſcription, to embrace the articles of <hi>Perth,</hi> the Canons, the Leiturgie, and all the intended novations, at leaſt, without all doubt Epiſcopacie, the Fountaine whence the reſt had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; and from which they knew they would flow againe in due time, if it alone could be gotten preſerved.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:624:88"/>
            <p>This was the true intention of the Commiſſioner in preſſing that new ſubſcription, as his Grace did publiſh thereafter in print, but in the firſt propoſition of that new oath, all ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne was carefully concealed, yet wiſe men among us, fearing and foreſeing the plot, did carefully diſwade that new ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, as a dangerous maſter piece, invented for the utter deſtruction of the true ſenſe of our firſt ſubſcribed Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>Their advice was heard by the moſt part, who thereupon refuſed that new ſubſcription, yet ſome knowing perfectly well, that the Covenant in the 1581, did not include Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, or any of the late novations, but clearely enough excluded them; Since the Commiſſioner his Grace in the proponing that ſubſcription, did make no declaration at all, neither of his owne, nor of his Maſter the Kings minde, to have Epiſcopacie, or any of theſe novations included in that Covenant, they were content at his deſire to ſubſcribe it, but with this expreſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, which they required and obtained to be acted in the Counſell Bookes (ſo farre were they from any Equivocation) that they did ſubſcribe that Covenant in that ſame ſenſe and no other, wherein it was underſtood at the firſt framing in the 1580.</p>
            <p>What that ſenſe was, we had for a time too much diſpute, but at laſt the Regiſters of our Church in the generall Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, being carefully caſt over, it was found that the doctrine and diſcipline of our Church in that 80. yeare, did runne ſo croſſe to Epiſcopacie, to <hi>Perth</hi> articles, to the Leiturgie, and all the reſt of our troubleſome novelties, that whoſoever did heartily ſubſcribe the Covenant of our Church in that ſenſe, it behoved to have in the yeare of his firſt framing, did ſtand no leſſe oblidged thereby to renounce the poſteriour novati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then thoſe who had ſubſcribed the other Covenant with the addition, wherein all theſe novations were expreſſely named: It was found even in our laſt Aſſembly, whereto <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaire</hi> according to his commiſſion from the King did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that both theſe Covenants, that with the application, and
